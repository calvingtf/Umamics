Stood in line for about 15 minutes, then the door matron let me in, to stand in another line(very long). Was chatting with a couple in line and, one of them said you can sit at the bar and get quicker service. So I sauntered over to the one remaining seat. The bartender was friendly, took my order. Only waited about 15 minutes and the food was brought out on a metal tray. BTW, they have Stevia and Sugar in the Raw for sweeteners. A-plus. The Burger (a Classic, )was good. Fries were over cooked. Got out for around $16.\n",

      "\n",
      "And there you have it, simple and sweet, but make no mistake this place is not so simple but yet the employee's are sweet and very hard working. Everyone from the greeter standing outside in the rain (yes it started to sprinkle) making sure everyone had a menu and answered any questions that were asked. She even handed out some umbrella to customers who were in line but forgot to bring one!\n",

      "Because ACL was in town and the last day of the festival was cancelled due to rain, everyone invaded the SoCo area looking for things to do! We honestly waited in line for about an hour. It is crazy but we were bound and intent to eat here. Our greeter told us what to do once we entered the restaurant as she let us and a few of the other people who were in line in. \n",
      "\n",
      "As we were standing in line waiting to place our order, I decided to order a drink from the bar, I cannot remember the name, but it had bourbon and some other stuff in it. The bartender was friendly and made my drink strong. First couple of sips it was good but while we were waiting in line I started to itch and break out in small rashes on my arms and neck. I was super embarrassed walking back to the bar to ask for a refund. Both the bartender and the manager were concerned and offered to make me another drink. Not wanting to piss my body off anymore than it already was I just asked for a refund. The manager said not to worry that it is okay as I told her I have never returned a drink in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the servers came up to us after I got back in line and asked how many in our group, Minh said two and we were handed our table number. Was told after we placed our order that we could find our table to the right side of the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "We finally made it up to the counter to order, with all that was going on, I completely forgot what I wanted to order hoping Minh would take his sweet time ordering his meal I scanned the menu and found what sounded good to me.\n",

      "We got our drink, grabbed some utensils, and found our table. Our waiter brought our food out to us and asked if he could get us anything else (Ketchup, Mustard ect) he even came around and refilled our drink a couple of times! \n",
      "\n",
      "My shroom burger was cooked medium well and was full of juicy meaty goodness! The gluten free bun was light and airy and had taste not some stale cardboard excuse for a healthy bun.\n",
      "This burger was huge (it is true, everything is BIGGER in Texas) I found myself having to half my burger which fell a part in the process of cutting so I could eat it.\n",
      "One bite and I was hooked like a fish, the texture of the goat cheese and the mushrooms were the best part! \n",
      "\n",
      "The fries and queso were good so good in fact that I totally forgot that I am not really suppose to have any type of queso at all. Sadly, I was somewhat sick back at the hotel for a little bit. However, it was so worth it! Creamy queso with a kick of spice paired with grease free fries seasoned to a prefect crisp. It is everything you ever dreamed of in fries and cheese land!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a perfect burger for a prefect cooler, rainy day in SoCO!  A bonus point was that they loved my fries and queso photo on instagram! I really like when companies interact with their customers! \n",

      "- Alex, our server. She was extremely attentive and friendly.\n",
      "- Atmosphere. It was hip enough for SoCo or any large urban city.\n",
      "- Beer Selection. A refined selection of micro brews.\n",
      "- Chipolte Catsup. Home made goodness, not too sweet just the right amount of heat.\n",
      "- Chile Cheese. We used it for a dipping sauce for our burgers... YUM.\n",
      "- Camaraderie of our fellow diners waiting in the \"40 min\" queue. It was fun to strike up a conversation about how this dining experience was starting to feel like an \"E\" ticket ride at Disney - there is something GREAT at the of this line and we will be reward for our patiences.\n",

Had a couple of out of town visitors for the day and we all decided to try Hopdoddy for lunch. The line to get in, which is normally down the block, was fairly short and manageable. My high hopes were lifted even more because of that. The line inside forms right down the middle of the restaurant. Which meant that my guests and I were asked to move out of a servers way many more times than once. Most were nice about it; you can't help being in the way because of how the line is set up. One server, who was apparently having a very bad day, was not so nice about it. He was downright rude, actually. And, no. We were not standing in the areas where signs directed us not to stand. We were merely standing in line waiting to order our food. We finally get to the counter to order. 2 burgers. 1 salad. Order of truffle fries. 2 milkshakes. 1 beer. Over $70 with tax and tip. That's a lot of money for a burger joint. I was also a little taken aback at being asked to tip before any service was given. But I did tip, because I appreciate and respect the work of food service workers. Got our table. Nice young woman brings our order. The truffle fries were amazing. Best part of the whole meal. Milkshakes were good, but not $6 each good. The burgers were the biggest disappointment. The other burger orderer at my table said his was ok, but not nearly as good as he had thought it might be. I took a bite of his. His assessment was correct. It was just a decent burger, nothing special. Mine was grossly undercooked in the middle. Our server never came back to the table to check on us and a very kind young man offered to go find her. She finally showed up after I had eaten the cooked edges of the burger and was no longer in the mood for the rest of it, cooked or not. I didn't really want another burger at that point. I didn't want what was left of the one I had to be cooked some more. Maybe I would have wanted those things 30-40 minutes earlier if she had ever come back to the table. She didn't offer any of those things, anyway, so it was a good thing I didn't want them, I suppose. She apologized that my burger was so undercooked. And left. I was appreciative that I at least got that. Maybe I went to Hopdoddy on a bad day. Maybe another visit would prove more satisfying. Not sure yet, whether I'm willing to give it another try or not. Those truffle fries sure were good, though. But, still.\n",

I went at 3:30 on a weekday so I could try the food without waiting in line and that plan worked.  I had the Classic - ordered medium and served very well done.  The burger nearly beat me to my table PROVING that the patty was pre-cooked.  There was a meager gram of thin sliced rings of yellow onion.  The largest ring had been the outer-most ring of the onion which made it fibrous and indelicate to eat.  One 2\" diameter slice of tomato with another chip of tomato and a nice piece of leaf lettuce.  The bread was phenomenal but the burger was flavorless and devoid of seasoning.\n",

I asked the cashier what she suggested and she said \"umm i don't know, a salad? *giggles*\"  Yeah, not funny after waiting for over 20 minutes just to be told I have to get a stupid overpriced salad.\n",
      "\n",
      "We place the order and then we're told that our table was outside and they told us the number for our table. Sure enough, the tables weren't numbered and we were just annoyed by that point, that we sat down at whatever table was available. THEN we still wait another 15 minutes for our food, just to get a sad, highly-acidic, rip-your-tongue-out balsamic vinaigrette salad. \n",

      "4.0 Saw this on Food Network and felt we must travel to see the hoop-la. We enjoyed the parmesean fries and the varied burgers between the 6 of us. Delicious and quick as it was ordered to specification. It was raining (which was rare) and I was sold when the doorman came to us (and others) with several umbrellas which calmed the slight wait. It was all worth it. Your table is \"pre-set\" and the men in the group were pleasantly surprised w/ the TV monitors available for the games!! The staff was EXCELLENT and friendly. The raspberry bar drink was not palatable for me, and the bartender showed much remorse and wanted to make sure I was pleased.... YES, I was. Gotta go back, maybe I will be bold enough to try the buffalo or lamb burger like my family did!!  :)\n",
